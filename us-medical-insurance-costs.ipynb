    "### Context\n",
    "Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz is a book that provides an introduction to machine learning using R. As far as I can tell, Packt Publishing does not make its datasets available online unless you buy the book and create a user account which can be a problem if you are checking the book out from the library or borrowing the book from a friend. All of these datasets are in the public domain but simply needed some cleaning up and recoding to match the format in the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content\n",
    "- age: age of primary beneficiary\n",
    "- sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male\n",
    "- bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9\n",
    "- children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents\n",
    "- smoker: Smoking\n",
    "- region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.\n",
